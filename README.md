# shiny-template
_I'd like to open source everything, but sometimes I cannot do it._

Hopefully, this R/Shiny Template would be helpful for beginners.

## Usage
There are two sections:

- `ui.R`: overall structure
- `server.R`: read data and visualisation

Tip: use box to show each block (easy to manage / more readable)

_note: it is just an UI template_
