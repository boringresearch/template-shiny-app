# shiny-template
_I'd like to open source everything, but sometimes I cannot do it._

Hopefully, this R/Shiny Template would be helpful for beginners. It contains a few panels + welcome page.

## Usage
There are three sections:

- `ui.R`: overall structure
- `server.R`: read data and visualisation
- `insert.html`: welcome information

Tip: boxes make things easy to read and manage

_note: it is just an UI template_
